# Zomato-clone
The Zomato Clone Website is a responsive front-end project built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout of a restaurant discovery platform with a structured homepage, navigation bar, and restaurant listing cards. The project focuses on clean UI design, responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid, and improving front-end development skills.
